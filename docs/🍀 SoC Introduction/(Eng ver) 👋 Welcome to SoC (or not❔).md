# THE INTRODUCTION  
  
Before stepping into my universe (opening SoC folder), please look through this note.    
  
First of all, I truly don't feel a bit grateful to the ones who come here today. So, [[hasta la vista]] ! :))) 👋  
  
...  
  
Assuming that you stay, allow me to start by saying a few words about me: **Meo Clover**. (I don't use the word "self-introducing" because that's what I hate, see my hate list at [[Words I Hate|Words I Hate]]).  
  
*Who is Meo Clover? Who writes this note? Who is the master of SoC? Why I need to read this one? Bla bla and bla bla...* 🤔  
  
This note is the door to my world. It is just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see. I cannot show you all about me neither in this note nor in this Obsidian. However; through this one, the most important trait of me shall be revealed and portrayed:  
  
==**I AM ENIGMA.**==  
  
If SoC is a subject to be learned, Meo Clover is a book to be read, then Enigma will be its initial lesson, its first page to be approached.  
  
Opening the folder SoC, you might find a range of strange folders with strange titles, which makes you extremely confused and feel like you are in a labyrinth. *Why does everything have to be so complicated? Why not giving intelligible names? Why using a lot of metaphor and metonymy? What is the purpose of this mess? Am I standing on a crazy land of a crazy man? Is the author of this place delusional?...* Please always be aware of these things:  
  
This is not your house.  
This is not a place to rest after an entire day staying outside with weariness.  
This is not a place to search for simplicity or entertainment.  
  
Then?   
  
This is my house.  
This is a place to dig very deep to hunt for treasures.  
This is a place to search for complication, and wisdom, soul.  
  
This is a place to get inside of me, my real me, to know me better. :)))  
  
This is a place for people who loved me, love me, and will love me.  
  
Thus, in case that this place cannot meet your needs, you get lost and don't know where you are, please get out of my ground right now and {be my strangers}.  
  
Otherwise, be my guests, take my hand, and I can show you the world, my universe: **SoC**.

# THE TABLE OF CONTENTS  
  
  
This is the explanation and interpretation for folders in the SoC.  
  
SoC has some certain similarities to human universe. It includes the main factors: time, energy, space & ordinary matter, dark energy & dark matter. (I don't excel at physics so pardon me if you read any false knowledge. But you can help me correct it.)  
  
## 1. Time  
  
This is where all things related to time are stored.  
  
*⏰ Schedule*: Meo's weekly **schedule** will be updated at [[06032023]]  
(If you don't see ⏰ Schedule => you are currently in The Mirage Island vault => you are not permitted to access this folder.)  
  
*🎯 Bujo*:: **Bullet Journal**: A brief descriptive picture of Meo's overall day will be updated at [[../🍀 SoC/⏳ Time/🎯 Bujo/01052023|01052023]]:  
- 👤: In the center of the picture is Meo's avatar. It is created by [Charat Choco Chibi Maker] (https://charat.me/chibi/create/). Every day, Meo's ava will change in emotions (through eyebrows, mouth) to represent Meo's mood that day, change in hair color to represent the color of the day, and change in clothes.  
![[../tải xuống (1) 1.png|tải xuống (1) 1.png]]  
- ⭐: Above the ava's head, in the left corner of the picture, is a star with the name of Person Of The Day (the character with the highest score in the Cow Game) as a tribute to that one.  
If you don't know what a bullet journal is, you can read more here [Bujo] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal)  
In my opinion, bujo is a useful way to look back on how a day went by.  
  
## 2. Energy  
## 3. Space & Ordinary matter  
## 4. Dark energy & Dark matter
